# Psychological Horror Game 👻

## 📖 Overview
This is a **decision-based 3D psychological horror game** where the player explores a haunted mansion in the forest.  
The player must **collect cursed artifacts** to break the legend, survive encounters with the villain, and escape with their soul intact.  
Entering the villain’s room unprepared results in eternal entrapment.  

The game emphasizes **psychological tension, immersive exploration, and player interpretation of whispers** from past victims.

## 🗂 Project Board  

We use a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Softeeng/projects/3) to plan and track development.  
The board organizes tasks into **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done** so progress is transparent.  

### 📌 Current Focus  
- Expanding rooms with multiple doorways  
- Implementing basic lighting and atmosphere  
- Finalizing player movement
